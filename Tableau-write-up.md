# Tableau Story:  Baseball Player Performance Dataset
by: *Tim Roberts*

### Summary  

This data review plans to visualize the discoveries and findings on the performance of the baseball players dataset. The exploratory data analysis will be done utilizing Tableau.  The dataset is composed of 1,157 baseball players.  Features of the baseball players include their handedness (right, left, or both), height (in inches) and, weight (in pounds), batting average and, number of home runs.

Various visualizations are utilized, for example, histograms, dot plots, line and area charts to check whether there are any correlations between the features, and to answer the question is there any correlation that could bring about a higher batting average or more home runs.

[*Final Version*](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tim6018#!/vizhome/BaseballPlayerPerformancev2/PlayerHomeRuns)


When thinking about the data and how to visualize it I assumed that the bigger the player the more home runs a player would have.  In the beginning, I decided to show the distribution of weight and height and show the correlation between the two.  

Next, I decided to show some visualizations of home runs that were made by player handedness.  Afterward, I made some histograms showing the distribution of player performance by weight and height.  Next, I decided to look for any trend between weight and height and home runs by making a few scatter plots with trend lines.  I had assumed that perhaps there was a correlation between home runs and hitting average and decided to make a scatter plot showing their relation.

Finally, I made a list of the top 15 players to see if any were on both lists.  To my surprise, only one player was on both lists. 

### Feedback

I asked my wife and daughter for feedback on the initial story.  The following is a summary of their comments:

* Add more colors to make charts easier to read.
* Change legend  from R L B to Right Left Both.
* Add tooltips for hover over data.


### Conclusion

Generally player weight increases as height increases.  The average weight and height are approximately 180 to 185 pounds and 72 inches.

More than half of the home runs were made by right-handed players.  While 1 out of 3 was done by left-handed and approximately 1 out of 16 was done by using either hand.

Most home runs were made by players between 175 and 200 pounds with a height between 72 and 74 inches.  Higher hitting averages were made by slightly lighter players.

Interestingly weight has a slightly positive trend to home runs while it has a slightly negative trend when related to hitting average.

Generally, the number of home runs increases with hitting average.

Interestingly that only one player is on both lists.  The heavier players are at the top home runs list while players at the top of the hitting average list are lighter.
